Writing scripts
===============

A collection of scripts (simple programs you run from a command prompt)
that will help you find weak spots in in your scientific writing.

Usage
-----

If the script (.sh extension) is in the same folder as your text file run:

    ./weaselwords.sh  yourpaper.txt

New ideas from:
 Kristin Sainani via the "Writing in the Sciences" course https://class.coursera.org/sciwrite-2012-001/

I plan to make more scripts as the class progresses.
Contributions are welcome.
